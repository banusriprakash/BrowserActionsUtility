# BrowserActionsUtility
Selenium BrowserActions Utility 🚀A robust, production-ready Selenium Java utility wrapper designed to enhance test stability, handle dynamic web elements, and simplify browser interactions.📌 OverviewThe BrowserActions class acts as the Intelligence Layer of a Selenium automation framework. It abstracts complex WebDriver commands into simple, reusable methods, focusing on three core pillars: Synchronization, Visibility, and Traceability.✨ Key FeaturesSmart Synchronization: Integrated WebDriverWait for all interactions to eliminate "flaky" tests caused by timing issues.JavaScript Fallbacks: Uses JavascriptExecutor for forced clicks, smooth scrolling, and Shadow DOM interactions.Visual Debugging: * Auto-Highlighting: Elements are highlighted in yellow during interaction.Smart Screenshots: Automated screenshot capture using Java NIO with dynamic timestamps.Window Management: Simplified tab/window switching and lifecycle management.Shadow DOM Support: Specialized methods to interact with elements hidden inside shadow roots.Comprehensive State Checks: Built-in methods to verify if elements are clickable, enabled, or disabled.🛠️ Core Methods1. Element InteractionMethodDescriptionclickElement(String xpath)Waits for clickability and executes a JS-based click.sendText(String xpath, String text)Highlights the field, clears it, and sends the specified text.scrollAndClick(String xpath)Centers the element in the viewport before clicking.2. Explicit WaitsMethodDescriptionwaitUntilElementVisible(xpath)Blocks execution until the element is present in the DOM and visible.waitUntilClickable(xpath)Ensures the element is ready for mouse interaction.3. Utility & NavigationMethodDescriptioncaptureScreenshot(String name)Captures and saves a PNG to the src/test/java/ScreenShots/ directory.switchToWindowByIndex(int)Manages multi-window scenarios easily.findShadowElement(host, inner)Bridges the gap for modern Web Component testing.🚀 Getting StartedPrerequisitesJava 11+ (Optimized for Java 17/21)Selenium WebDriver 4.xSLF4J for loggingInstallationClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/BrowserActionsUtility.git
Ensure your Driver class is properly configured to return a ThreadLocal WebDriver instance.Usage ExampleJava// Navigate and Login
BrowserActions.get("https://example.com");
BrowserActions.sendText(login_xpath, "my_username");
BrowserActions.clickElement(submit_button_xpath);

// Verify State
if(BrowserActions.isElementEnabled(dashboard_xpath)) {
    System.out.println("Login Successful!");
}
